The `node-switchbot` is a Node.js module that allows you to interact with various SwitchBot devices. You can control your [SwitchBot (Bot)'s](https://www.switch-bot.com/bot) arm, operate your [SwitchBot Curtain](https://www.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-curtain), and manage your [SwitchBot Lock](https://www.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-lock). Additionally, you can monitor temperature and humidity using the [SwitchBot Thermometer & Hygrometer (Meter)](https://www.switch-bot.com/meter), and check the status of the [SwitchBot Motion Sensor](https://www.switch-bot.com/products/motion-sensor) and [SwitchBot Contact Sensor](https://www.switch-bot.com/products/contact-sensor).

This module now supports both Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and the SwitchBot OpenAPI, providing more flexibility and options for interacting with your devices.

Please note that most of this module was developed by referencing the official [BLE API](https://github.com/OpenWonderLabs/SwitchBotAPI-BLE) and [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OpenWonderLabs/SwitchBotAPI) documentation. However, some functionalities were developed through trial and error, so there might be inaccuracies in the information obtained from this module.
